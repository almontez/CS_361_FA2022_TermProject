Hi Lauren!

Thank you for working with me this term. I'm excited to be working with you.
This folder will hold the sample data for the email microservice. 

The microservice should send an email reminder to the user. 

The first email should be a confirmation email. 
It should be sent within minutes of the user creating the reminder.
It should include the following:
    - Some text explaining the purpose of the email
    - A link back to the web application
    - Some sign off (optional)

The second email should be the actual reminder email. 
It should be sent 30 minutes before the necessary move time.
It should include: 
    - Some text explaining the purpose of the email
    - A link back to the web application
    - Some sign off (optional)

The data for the reminder comes from this site: https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Street-Sweeping-Schedule/yhqp-riqs

The data will be sent as a JSON. The JSON fields are "email", "days", "start_hr", "end_hr". 
These fields correspond to email from the web app and FullName, FromHour, and ToHour from the data.sfgov.org site.
FromHour and ToHour are in 24 hour format (site). However, "start_hr" and "end_hr" are in 12-hr format (app form).
Sample data can be found in the sampledata directory (i.e. this directory). Use this data to test your microservice.

The communication pipe will likely be a REST/RESTful API.

All code should be housed in the CS_361_FA2022_TermProject Repository. 
You can create your own folder to house your code in the repository. 

You can clone or fork the repository. When you need to merge in code, you can submit a pull request.
