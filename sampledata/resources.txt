Hi Lauren!

Thank you for working with me this term. I'm excited to be working with you.
This folder will hold the sample data for the email microservice. 

The microservice should send an email reminder to the user. 

The first email should be a confirmation email. 
It should be sent within minutes of the user creating the reminder.
It should include the following:
    - Some text explaining the purpose of the email
    - A link back to the web application
    - Some sign off (optional)

The second email should be the actual reminder email. 
***It should be sent at 11:00 AM the day before the necessary move time.
If the user creates a reminder after 11:00 AM of the day before, immediately send reminder.
It should include: 
    - Some text explaining the purpose of the email
    - A link back to the web application
    - Some sign off (optional)

*** Note: This is a change from our initial discussion. Some of the cleaning times
are quite early like 12:00 AM or 2:00 AM. As such, a generalized reminder at 11:00 AM 
the day before sounds like a more reasonable reminder. Open to suggestions.

The data for the reminder comes from this site: https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Street-Sweeping-Schedule/yhqp-riqs

The data will be sent as a JSON. The JSON fields are "date", "time", "email", "days", "start_hr", "end_hr". 
    - date: date reminder created               [format: YYYY-MM-DD]
    - time: time reminder created               [format: 24-hr]
    - email: user email                         [format: email]
    - days: cleaning days                       [format: string]
    - start_hr: start time of street cleaning   [format: string, 12-hr]
    - end_hr: end time of street cleaning       [format: string, 12-hr]

Sample data can be found in the sampledata directory (i.e. this directory). Use this data to test your microservice.
** Note: HOLIDAY means every day MON-SUN

The communication pipe will likely be a REST/RESTful API.

All code should be housed in the CS_361_FA2022_TermProject Repository. 
You can create your own folder to house your code in the repository. 

You can clone or fork the repository. When you need to merge in code, you can submit a pull request.
